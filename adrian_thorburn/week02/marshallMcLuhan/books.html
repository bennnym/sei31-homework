      <p><img src="/Users/adrianthorburn/Projects/sei31-homework/adrian_thorburn/week02/marshallMcLuhan/images/books/The_Mechanical_Bride.jpg" alt=""><a class="booktitle">The Mechanical Bride(1951)</a><br/>A study of popular culture where newspapers, comics, and advertisements are treated as poetic texts. Example advertisements, newspaper or magazine articles are followed by an essayed analysis </p>
      <p><img src="/Users/adrianthorburn/Projects/sei31-homework/adrian_thorburn/week02/marshallMcLuhan/images/books/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy.jpg" alt=""><a class="booktitle">The Gutenberg Galaxy(1962)</a><br/>Marshall McLuhan analyzes the effects of mass media, especially the printing press, on European culture and human consciousness.</p>
      <p><img src="/Users/adrianthorburn/Projects/sei31-homework/adrian_thorburn/week02/marshallMcLuhan/images/books/Understanding_Media.jpg" alt=""><a class="booktitle">Understanding Media(1964)</a><br/>A pioneering study in media theory where McLuhan proposes that the media, not the content that they carry, should be the focus of study. He suggests that the medium affects the society in which it plays a role mainly by the characteristics of the medium rather than the content.</p>
      <p><img src="/Users/adrianthorburn/Projects/sei31-homework/adrian_thorburn/week02/marshallMcLuhan/images/books/MediumMassage.jpg" alt=""><a class="booktitle">The Medium Is the Massage(1967)</a><br/>Marshall McLuhan argues technologies — from clothing to the wheel to the book and beyond — are the messages, not the content of the communication. Basically, in its fundamental essence, The Medium is the Massage is a graphical and creative representation of his "medium is the message" thesis seen in Understanding Media.</p>
      <p><img src="/Users/adrianthorburn/Projects/sei31-homework/adrian_thorburn/week02/marshallMcLuhan/images/books/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village.jpg" alt=""><a class="booktitle">War and Peace in the Global Village(1968)</a><br/>McLuhan used James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, an inspiration for this study of war throughout history, as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future. Joyce's Wake is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its Ten Thunders. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced.</p>
      <p><img src="/Users/adrianthorburn/Projects/sei31-homework/adrian_thorburn/week02/marshallMcLuhan/images/books/From_Cliche_to_Archetype.jpg" alt=""><a class="booktitle">From Cliché to Archetype(1970)</a><br/>In his 1970 book, From Cliché to Archetype, McLuhan, collaborating with Canadian poet Wilfred Watson,[77] approached the various implications of the verbal cliché and of the archetype. One major facet in McLuhan's overall framework introduced in this book that is seldom noticed is the provision of a new term that actually succeeds the global village; the global theater. In McLuhan's terms, a cliché is a "normal" action, phrase, etc. which becomes so often used that we are "anesthetized" to its effects.</p>

      <p><img src="/Users/adrianthorburn/Projects/sei31-homework/adrian_thorburn/week02/marshallMcLuhan/images/books/theglobalvillage.jpg" alt=""><a class="booktitle">The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st Century(1989)</a><br/>In his 1989 posthumous book, The Global Village, McLuhan, collaborating with Bruce R. Powers, provided a strong conceptual framework for understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated with the rise of a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models such as the Shannon–Weaver model.</p>
