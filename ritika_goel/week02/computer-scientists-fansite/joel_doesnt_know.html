Patent titleMobile device resistant to malware
Patent dateIssued Feb 26, 2019  Patent issuer and numberus 10216935

Patent descriptionA mobile device is made resistant to malware. Wireless mobile devices are paired with short-distance wireless technology to separate user gadgets like keyfobs. Two or more pieces of security passwords are escrowed separately amongst the physically distinct devices. Neither the mobile device nor its matching keyfob store or keep entire passwords.

Patent titleMobile device password management and escrow with keyfob
Patent dateIssued Dec 19, 2017  Patent issuer and numberus 9848324

Patent descriptionPhysical security methods and equipment are applied to mobile devices that use multi-factor authentication mobile apps. Herein, a password management mobile app physically escrows each encrypted password that must be stored into two parts. These are then distributed between two separate, independent physical devices. Only one of those parts is kept only in a separate user gadget like a keyfob. Any reconstitution of each password after decryption requires that the user have on-hand both the mobile device and the separate user gadget. Such reconstitution is one password at a time, and only as needed, and released for use in remote authentication with a master user password entry.

Systems and Methods for Capturing, Replaying, or Analyzing Time-Series Data
Patent dateIssued Jan 12, 2016  Patent issuer and numberus 9237164

Patent descriptionProvided is an intrusion detection system configured to detect anomalies indicative of a zero-day attack by statistically analyzing substantially all traffic on a network in real-time. The intrusion detection system, in some aspects, includes a network interface; one or more processors communicatively coupled to the network interface; system memory communicatively coupled to the processors. The system memory, in some aspects, stores instructions that when executed by the processors cause the processors to perform steps including: buffering network data from the network interface in the system memory; retrieving the network data buffered in the system memory; applying each of a plurality of statistical or machine-learning intrusion-detection models to the retrieved network data; aggregating intrusion-likelihood scores from each of the intrusion-detection models in an aggregate score, and upon the aggregate score exceeding a threshold, outputting an alert.
