<p class="fragment">
1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.
</p>
<p class="fragment">

3. A person capable of appreciating hack value.
</p>
<p class="fragment">

4. A person who is good at programming quickly.
</p>
<p class="fragment">

5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in ‘a Unix hacker’. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)
</p>
<p class="fragment">

6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example.
</p>
<p class="fragment">

7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.
</p>
<p class="fragment">

8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence password hacker, network hacker. The correct term for this sense is cracker.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled bogus). See also geek, wannabee.

GEEK / HACKER CULTURE

        					<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/larval-stage.html">Larval Stage</a>: n.</h2>
        					<blockquote>Describes a period of monomaniacal concentration on coding apparently passed through by all fledgling hackers. Common symptoms include the perpetration of more than one 36-hour hacking run in a given week; neglect of all other activities including usual basics like food, sleep, and personal hygiene; and a chronic case of advanced bleary-eye. Can last from 6 months to 2 years, the apparent median being around 18 months. A few so afflicted never resume a more ‘normal’ life, but the ordeal seems to be necessary to produce really wizardly (as opposed to merely competent) programmers.</blockquote>
