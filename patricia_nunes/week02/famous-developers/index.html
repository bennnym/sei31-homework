        "Computer are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind." 
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        Donald Ervin Knuth, born January 10, 1938, is an American computer scientist, mathematician, 
        and professor emeritus at Stanford University.
      </p>

      <p>
        He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming. He contributed to 
        the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and 
        systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the 
        asymptotic notation. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of 
        theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, 
        the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern 
        family of typefaces.
      </p>      

      <p>
        As a writer and scholar, Knuth created the WEB and CWEB computer programming systems designed 
        to encourage and facilitate literate programming, and designed the MIX/MMIX instruction set 
        architectures. Knuth strongly opposes granting software patents, having expressed his opinion 
        to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation.
