                      Every time I look at you I don't understand<br />
                      Why you think "Do What I Mean" is so cool and grand;<br />
                      You'd have managed better if you'd thought it through,<br />
                      Why'd you pick such an awkward way your bugs to undo?<br />
                      Your hairy feature will not be the last revolution,<br />
                      It's clear "Mean What I Do" is the ultimate solution!<br />

                        <br />
                        My programming day has come to an end, I know,<br />
                        But one minor bug still restrains me, though,<br />
                        So back to me desk I stumble,<br />
                        More coffee I pour in my mug,<br />
                        And I drink, and I think, and I program<br />
                        Just one more hack, just one more hairy kludge<br />
                        To remove that bug.<br />
                        <br />
                        Machines are alive with the sound of FORTRAN,<br />
                        With numbers they've crunched for a thousand hours;<br />
                        They add and subtract to the sound of FORTRAN,<br />
                        And raise fractions to unheard of powers.<br />
                        <br />
                        My code's full of REAL statements, INTEGER and COMPLEX too,<br />
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;duplicated thrice oe'r,<br />
                        And so intermixed with the WRITEs and READs<br />
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to cause errors galore;<br />
                        Arrays are declared of dimension six, but indexed minus two;<br />
                        Computed GO TOs are last in the range of a DO!<br />
                        <br />
                        I now recompile my corrected programs;<br />
                        I know I will get what compiled before --<br />
                        My code will be blessed with the sound of FORTRAN,<br />
                        And I'll lose once more.<br />

                          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Why the consequent mess<br />
