        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          A New England native, he graduated from Boston Latin before spending his undergraduate and graduate years shuttling between Harvard and MIT, where he received his Ph.D. in 1980. After a short stint as a professor at Carnegie Mellon, he joined the famed yet ill-fated Thinking Machines, a company not shy about its ambitions for AI. He eventually settled down at Sun Microsystems, where he helped make Java the current lingua franca for coding. Despite his programming prowess, Steele says: “At heart I’m really—well, I was about to say ‘a software guy,’ but the truth is that I’m a writer.”
        </p>
        <h3>Quux</h3>
        <p>
          Originally, quux was a metasyntactic variable, which is a name used in examples and understood to stand for whatever thing is under discussion, or any random member of a class of things under discussion. Essentially being a random name for something where the name does not matter. Other examples are ack, bar , baz, blarg, wibble, foo , and fum. Qux was one such variable spread by Guy Steele, that he later used as apart of his pen name.

        <h3>The Writer</h3>
        <p>
          As The Great Quux, Guy Steel created a variety of programming humour poems labeled "Random Poetry and Other Losses", and a programming comic series known as "The Crunchly cartoons".
          He was still very much writer as Guy Steele. He helped turn the jargon.txt document on the MIT database into the original "Hacker's Dictionary", which we now know as the "Jargon File" ("or the New Hackers Dictionary"). He and Gerald Sussman created the language Scheme (a dialect of Lisp), as well as a set of papers known as "The Lambda Papers".
