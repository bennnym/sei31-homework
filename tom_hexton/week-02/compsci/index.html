			<h4>what did he do?</h4>
			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>Mendax has been called the robin hood of hacking, instead of stealing money from the rich and poweful he's been stealing information and posting it online. Mendax, the founder and face of WikiLeaks, is none other than Australia's own Julian Assange.</p>
			<p>Assange, who began his foray into programming at the enviously early age of 16, quickly fell in love and promptly realised the potential for impact. In his youth he was a founding member of a hacker group who claims they had US Military's computer networks under surveillance for close to 2 years. Sadly, he was busted but only ever changed lightly.</p>
			<p>But Assange — who reportedly lived an itinerant existence, traveling the world with a backpack and computer — is himself a shadowy figure. Little is known about his life: he has refused to confirm his age in interviews or give a fixed address. But on July 26, the mathematically-trained Australian changed the media landscape — and possibly the course of history — by releasing about 90,000 classified U.S. military records from the war in Afghanistan.</p>
			<p>We of course now know he's housed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He's also fighting extradition to both the US and Sweden on separate charges whilst also being a fugitive in the UK after failing to present at court hearings.</p>
